                    04/08/25 3:30am - I miss you, I miss us. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it:<< I just want to be with you but why do you have to go thereee?? why is the world always againts us??
                    why do I have to be so far away from you? I just want to be with you and only youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu:<< God did gave me another chance with you pero bakit ganito?
                    I never thought it would end like this. Admiring you from afar and not having any chances with you is better than not seeing you at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    04/03/25 - Didn't go to school cause they said we cannot use the court to practice so I just stayed at home. What's the point of going to school if I wouldn't be able to see you there.
                    <br>

                    12/21/24 - I was at the church that time like 3am or something. I was playing with my phone when I noticed
                    that "his" user was no longer at your bio. I got worried and couldn't even focus on the mass.
                    Only thing that comes to my mind was to ask god to comfort you and take care of you.
                    I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    01/01/25 - Decided to improve myself for you.

                    03/31/25 - I saw you while we were at graduation practice thingy. I was so happy to see you that I couldn't even focus on what the teachers were saying.
                    I just found myself staring at you till the practice was over.
                    <br>

                    04/01/25 - I tried putting a notification on my code so I'll be reminded if you already cliked the link I sent you through NGL.
